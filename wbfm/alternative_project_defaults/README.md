# Alternative config file defaults for specific project types

Each folder here will contain specific config.yaml files, which can be copied to created projects using the copy_config_file_to_multiple_projects.sh script.
See that script for help and more details.

Custom config files can be created for specific project types, and then copied in the same way.
