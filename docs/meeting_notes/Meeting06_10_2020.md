# Meeting notes 06.10.2020

Decided to:
- place meeting notes in this repo
- Add other computational protocols to the "Protocols" repository the Zimmer lab bitbucket (link below)
- Use diagrams (draw.io) to give an overview of protocols and strategies
- Use this repository for all of Charlies' code for WBFM analysis
- Use /shared_projects/wbfm/dat/ as the folder where we put our data

Resources:
- https://bitbucket.imp.ac.at/projects/ZL
- draw.io
